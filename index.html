            <h2><i>by Muse</i></h2>
            <p>You're just too good to be true; 
                Can't take my eyes off you. 
                You'd be like Heaven to touch; 
                I wanna hold you so much. 
                At long last love has arrived, 
                And I thank God I'm alive. 
                You're just too good to be true; 
                Can't take my eyes off you.</p>
            <p>Pardon the way that I stare
                There's nothing else to compare
                The sight of you makes me weak
                There are no words left to speak
                But if you feel like I feel
                Please let me know that it's real
                You're just too good to be true
                Can't take my eyes off of you</p>
            <p>I love you, baby
                And if it's quite all right
                I need you, baby
                To warm the lonely nights
                I love you, baby
                Trust in me when I say
                Oh, pretty baby
                Don't bring me down, I pray
                Oh, pretty baby
                Now that I found you, stay
                And let me love you, baby
                Let me love you</p>
            <p>You're just too good to be true
                Can't keep my eyes off of you
                You feel like heaven to touch
                I wanna hold you so much
                At long last love has arrived
                And I thank God I'm alive
                You're just too good to be true
                Can't take my eyes off of you</p>
