            <h2><i>by Muse</i></h2>
            <p>You're just too good to be true;<br> 
                Can't take my eyes off you.<br> 
                You'd be like Heaven to touch;<br>
                I wanna hold you so much.<br>
                At long last love has arrived,<br>
                And I thank God I'm alive.<br>
                You're just too good to be true;<br> 
                Can't take my eyes off you.</p>
            <p>Pardon the way that I stare<br>
                There's nothing else to compare<br>
                The sight of you makes me weak<br>
                There are no words left to speak<br>
                But if you feel like I feel<br>
                Please let me know that it's real<br>
                You're just too good to be true<br>
                Can't take my eyes off of you</p>
            <p>I love you, baby<br>
                And if it's quite all right<br>
                I need you, baby<br>
                To warm the lonely nights<br>
                I love you, baby<br>
                Trust in me when I say<br>
                Oh, pretty baby<br>
                Don't bring me down, I pray<br>
                Oh, pretty baby<br>
                Now that I found you, stay<br>
                And let me love you, baby<br>
                Let me love you</p>
            <p>You're just too good to be true<br>
                Can't keep my eyes off of you<br>
                You feel like heaven to touch<br>
                I wanna hold you so much<br>
                At long last love has arrived<br>
                And I thank God I'm alive<br>
                You're just too good to be true<br>
                Can't take my eyes off of you</p>
